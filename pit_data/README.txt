These data are preliminary and have not been reviewed for conformity with U.S. Geological Survey editorial standards.

Enclosed are CSV datafiles containing data for hydrologic years 2009-2012, separated into data sets pertaining to each of eight soil pits (SP1-SP8). Each set contains:

1. a serial timestamp (days since Jan. 0, 0000), 1-hour frequency, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
2. precipitation gage (RG)
3. volumetric water content (VWC) at shallow depth
4. VWC at mid-depth
5. VWC at greatest depth
6. pore-pressure at shallow depth
7. pore-pressure at mid-depth
8. pore-pressure at greatest depth

Metadata, including instrument depth and type, are shown in header. The timestamp and precipitation gage data are the same in each soil pit dataset. This data has undergone some processing which is described in the Open File Report 2013-1283 "Hydrologic monitoring of a landslide-prone hillslope in the Elliott State Forest, Southern Coast Range, Oregon, 2009-2012." Although these data were processed, there remain inaccuracies due to faulty instrumentation, or other random phenomena, which are described in the report.
